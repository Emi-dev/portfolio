### General Info
This is my portfolio that consists of three pages: About, Portfolio, and Contact.
It will open the deployed applications in the new tab by clicking on the images of the projects.
The link of the github repository for each project is under the image of the project.
In each page, there are links to my Linkedin, GitHub, Email, Phone, and Resume at the bottom.
Using Bootstrap, the website is created to be responsive to different size screens.
